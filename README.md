README: ArcPy Workflow for Geospatial Data Processing

Overview

This workflow is designed to process geospatial data using ArcPy within an ArcGIS Pro environment. It involves creating and managing spatial data, performing spatial joins, converting coordinate systems, and generating output shapefiles and feature classes. The following sections provide a step-by-step guide to understanding and executing the script.

Prerequisites

ArcGIS Pro: Installed and configured with the necessary licenses.

ArcPy: Python library for geographic data analysis.

Pandas: Python library for data manipulation and analysis.

Random: Python library for generating random numbers.

OS: Python library for interacting with the operating system.
